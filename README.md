# loess-rs
A simple implementation of the LOESS/LOWESS algorithm using Rust 
and [nalgebra](https://docs.rs/nalgebra/latest/nalgebra/index.html) based on
[NIST](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmd/section1/dep/dep144.htm).

The code in this repository implements the same algorithm as the one found 
here: [joaofig/pyloess](https://github.com/joaofig/pyloess).
